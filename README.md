# HCKG - Knowledge graph-based framework to support human-centered collaborative and ergonomic manufacturing in Industry 5.0

Abstract

The importance of highly monitored and analyzed processes connected by information systems such as knowledge graphs is increasing. 
Moreover, the integration of operators has also become urgent due to their high costs and from a social point of view. An adequate framework to implement the Industry 5.0 approach requires effective data exchange in a highly complex manufacturing network to utilize resources and information. Furthermore, the continuous development of collaboration between human and machine actors is fundamental for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems, as the workforce is one of the most agile and flexible manufacturing resources. This paper introduces the Human-Centric Knowledge Graph framework by adapting ontologies and standards to model the operator-related factors such as monitoring of movements, working conditions or collaboration with robots. Furthermore, graph-based data queries, visualization and analytics are also presented by an industrial case study. The main contribution of this work is a knowledge graph-based framework, where the work performed by the operator is in focus, including the evaluation of movements, collaboration with machines, ergonomics and other conditions. Additionally, utilization of the framework is demonstrated in a complex assembly line-based use case,  applying examples of resource allocation and comprehensive support concerning collaboration and ergonomic aspects between shop-floor workers.
